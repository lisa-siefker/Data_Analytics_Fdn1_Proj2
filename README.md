## Project Description 

Izembek Lagoon, an estuary in Alaska, is a very important staging area for Pacific brant, a small migratory goose. Each fall, nearly the entire Pacific Flyaway population of 130,000 brant flies to Izembek Lagoon and feeds on eelgrass to accumulate fat reserves for nonstop transoceanic migration to wintering areas as distant as Mexico. In the past 10 years, offshore drilling activities in this area have increased and, as a result, the air traffic in and out of the nearby Cold Bay airport has also increased. There has been concern that this increased air traffic could affect the brant by disturbing them from their feeding and resting activities, which in turn could result in reduced energy intake and buildup. This may increase the mortality rates durin gtheir migratory journey. Because of these concerns, a study was conducted to investigate the flight response of brant to overflights of large helicopters. Response was measured on flocks during experimental overflights of large helicopters flown at varying altitutdes and lateral (perpendicular) distances from the flocks. Results of this study will be used to guide the development of new FAA guidelines for airports near Izembek Lagoon. <br>

The data was used to answer the following questions: <br>

 1. What is the effect of helicopter altitude on the flight response of Pacific brant?
 2. What is the effect of helicopter lateral distance on the flight response of Pacific brant?
 3. That recommendations can you provide in terms of air traffic near flocks of Pacific brant?
